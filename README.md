# 1. What Steve Jobs learnt from Nike's marketing campaign that beats its rival Adidas.

The story that I'm about to tell you today is the story of a brand
that is not just an inspiration for people like you and me
but also for a legend like Steve Jobs.
People, in 1996 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple
Apple was crippling with losses because of 11 consecutive years of failure
and it was almost about to go bankrupt.
During this time when Steve Jobs came back to the company
the biggest challenge that he faced was the reputation of the company
which had degraded to such an extent that people had completely lost faith.
And that is the reason why he had to do something magical
to actually bring the company back on track.
During this time he came out with a legendary campaign called the 'Think Different' campaign
which even today is known as one of the greatest marketing campaigns ever.
And you know what people?
This campaign brought back the trust of the common man in Apple
and laid a solid foundation to such an extent
that today, if Apple is a trillion dollar company
it is only because of legendary campaigns like the 'Think Different' campaign.
So, when I was doing a deep dive
to try and understand what exactly was Steve Jobs thinking while he was designing the 'Think Different' campaign
I found an archived video wherein Steve Jobs is addressing his executive
and he states Nike to be one of his inspirations for the 'Think Different' campaign.
And that's when I started to think
what exactly is so special about a company that sells shoes
that it was able to inspire a legend like Steve Jobs.
And that's what is going to be the subject of this episode
wherein we are going to decode the historic greatness of Nike
with a classic example.
So, the story dates back to the year 2012 when Summer Olympics was being held in London.
And because the Summer Olympics was being held
all the sports brands were very eager to become the title sponsors of the Olympics
because they knew that if they could become the title sponsor of the Olympics
they could pump in a lot of profit.
So, the auction was held and the title sponsorship went to Adidas
and Nike lost its chance to become the title sponsor to its arch rival.
And adidas paid $150 million just to be the title sponsor of the Olympics.
And every time we hear a figure like this, the first question that comes to our mind is
what exactly is so special about the title sponsorship
that you would pay $150 million just to be associated with the name of Olympics.
And the answer to that lies in a very simple example
that is very closer to our home, that is, Vivo's title sponsorship to IPL.
Now, when I understood that Vivo is going to pay Rs 2,200 crores
just to get its name as 'Vivo IPL'
I got completely shocked
and that is when I looked at the growth of Vivo in 2018 and 2019
and as it turns out,
in 2018 Q1, that is, just before the IPL started
Vivo was shipping about 2.1 million units, alright?
But one year later, after the IPL happened
in the exact same quarter in 2019
Vivo was shipping 4.5 million units.
That's a staggering growth of more than 100%
in the world's second largest mobile market.
And this is the reason why
title sponsorship of any popular sports event
is a goldmine investment for any company.
And that's the reason why Olympics was like a golden gateway
for adidas to get way ahead of Nike.
And specifically, they also sat down with the Olympics committee
to try to make sure that they make such stringent rules
that no other brand, let alone Nike
will be able to steal their thunder by actually associating their name with Olympics.
So, the Olympics committee came out with a bunch of strict rules and regulations
that have to be followed by every single brand in such a way
that they could in no way associate themselves with the Olympics
and by the way this also included a list of words
which included the words 'London Olympics', 'Summer Olympics', 'Olympics', '2012'
'The rings of the Olympics' and so on and so forth.
So, theoretically it was made impossible for any brand
to get associated with Olympics
in any way that would steal the thunder of Adidas as a brand.
So, with all of this put together everybody thought that Adidas is now going to go viral
it's going to remain at the top of the chart
because now it is the title sponsor of the Olympics.
But you know what? There was a slight twist in between
and when the actual results came out
as it turns out, while adidas had about 9,000 tweets
associating adidas with the Olympics,
there were about 16,000 tweets that associated Nike with the Olympics.
Not just that, during the tenure of the Olympics
that is, starting from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony
adidas added about 12,000 followers to its social media handle
while Nike added 57,000 followers to its social media handle.
And the cherry on the cake is
there was a survey that was conducted in the US
wherein people were asked 'Who do you exactly think is the title sponsor of the Olympics?'
21% of those people thought that adidas is the title sponsor of the Olympics
BUT
37% of the people identified Nike to be the title sponsor of the Olympics.
Which means what?
Millions and millions of people were thinking
that Nike was the title sponsor of the Olympics and not adidas!
So, the question is
without being the title sponsor of the Olympics;
without spending $150 million;
without even using the keywords to associate yourself with the Olympics;
How is it even practically possible for a brand to acquire more publicity
than the real title sponsor?
And that's where the legendary strategy of Nike comes into play.
So, the first thing that they understood was
regardless of how complex the system is, there will always be a loophole.
And they found 3 loopholes.
The first loophole that they found was
regardless of whoever is the title sponsor of the Olympics
the athletes were free to choose whichever shoe they wanted.
And that is the reason why
Nike hired 400 Olympians to be its brand ambassador
and just asked them to wear the Nike shoe that they were given
And Nike came front with a quirky line of shoes which was named as Volt
wherein they distributed yellow-green coloured shoes
to the athletes to be worn during their matches.
And the reason why they specifically chose the yellow-green lineup was because
that colour was in perfect contrast of the tracks of the Olympics.
The second loophole that they found was in this rule
which prohibited Nike from showcasing the London of UK in their commercials.
But you know what?
The loophole here is
that there are 28 other locations in this world
which are named as London except the London of UK.
So, Nike shot their commercials in all other Londons
except London in UK.
So, the commercials were shot in London in Ohio,
Little London in Jamaica,
the London Hotel, the London Gym
Small London in Nigeria and even the London Road.
And very smartly
Nike was able to place the word 'London' in all of its commercials, legally.
And third and most importantly and here's where the sweet spot is.
Usually if you look at these Nike and Adidas commercials
you will see all the celebrities endorsing the brand
but when it comes to Nike, for the Olympics, they were not allowed to use Olympians for endorsement.
So, while adidas was actually flaunting all of its commercials
by hiring all of these Olympians to be its brand ambassador
Nike decided to hire average teenagers
as ambassadors for its brand endorsement.
I repeat, while adidas had Olympians
Nike hired average teenagers who were not known to anybody
as ambassadors to endorse its brand.
And came out with a beautiful masterpiece which literally, literally broke the Internet.
And this is what the commercial looked like.
Now, if you looked at that commercial closely, you must have realized
that just like Coca-Cola leveraged the emotion of happiness
to communicate its idea.
Nike leverages the emotion of inspiration to communicate its idea.
In both cases, both these brands
are trying to give you an involuntary experience of their commercial.
And if you look at Nike's commercial even more closely, you will see
that they don't want to talk about Usain Bolt.
They want to talk about the Usain Bolt spirit within every single individual
like you and like me.
And if you are somebody who is pushing your limits
every single day to become a better version of yourself
that Nike commercial is literally depicting your own story.
And because Nike managed to strike a cord with local champions
it was able to go trending and Nike was trending number one on YouTube
one week after the Olympics started
with 4.5 million views.
As compared to that,
adidas was at number three with only 2.9 million views.
And that's how without being the title sponsor,
without paying $150 million
and without actually using the banned keywords
Nike managed to steal the thunder from adidas
and emerged as a champion in this marketing war.
Now, we've got 3 very important lessons to learn from this entire case study.
Number one, do you realize
that even if Nike had not tried so hard
if the Olympics happened without Nike coming out with its 'Find Your Greatness' commercial
people would still remember Nike, right?
Nike wouldn't be forgotten and yet
Nike put in this extra efforts to actually come out with a beautiful commercial
to beat adidas inspite of all odds.
And that is because Nike, as a brand, realizes
that the only difference between ordinary and extraordinary
is that little extra.
In this case, it's Nike's efforts
to emerge as a legend inspite of all odds.
Number two,
people might forget what you said but they will never ever forget how you made them feel
and Nike's commercial is a classic depiction of this quote.
So, if you pick up some work to do, just make sure that it's remarkable.
Because in this world 99% of the people are good
but 1% are great and that is only because
they choose to be great.
Because every single champion today understands
that good is imperative but greatness is always, always a choice.
And last and most importantly,
like the legend says
'Somehow we have come to believe that greatness is meant only for a chosen few
that greatness is only meant for the superstar
but the truth is- greatness is for everyone.
It's not about lowering the expectation but about raising it for each one of us
because greatness is not in one special person or one special place
greatness is wherever somebody is trying to find it.
So, my dear friend, my question to you is
What are you doing to find your greatness?



# Toyota Kanban Approach 

In this video, we will discuss Toyota Kanban. We will start with an overview of the Toyota Production System.

In 1978, Taiichi Ohno considered to be the father of the Toyota Production System, wrote a book about the thinking behind the system.

In this book he describes what is now sometimes called lean thinking or lean management. We will see that this book contains many of the principles that are used in agile projects.

After World War II, Toyota had a goal to catch up with America in three years in the automobile industry. Japan's automobile industry was very small at the time compared to American companies like Ford and General Motors. The main focus of the Toyota production system is to eliminate waste and increase productivity. Taiichi Ohno had heard that American workers were something like nine times more productive than Japanese workers and decided that there must be a lot of wasted effort. The result was a decades long focus on eliminating waste and continuously improving. This eventually resulted in Toyota becoming the largest automobile company in the world.

Whether or not the productivity numbers were true that's what Toyota believed and helps explain their focus on eliminating waste.

Toyota studied and embraced many of the production ideas from Ford but used a more agile approach to producing cars. After World War II, resources were very scarce in Japan. And Toyota simply couldn't afford to hold a lot of inventory as was done in traditional mass production. Out of need, Toyota developed a leaner, more flexible approach to mass producing cars. We will see that this lean approach uses many of the same principles that are used today in agile projects.

In his book, Taiichi Ohno emphasized the need for the team to have a clear purpose. He said I would like to emphasize that the Toyota production systems was realized because there were always clear purposes and needs.

Lean principles of the Toyota production system can be applied in many contexts. They do not apply only to lean manufacturing or production. In fact, Taiichi Ohno wrote about this in the preface to the English edition of the book, which came out in 1988. He said the Toyota production system is not just a production system. I am confident it will reveal its strength as a management system adapted to today's era of global markets and high level computerized information systems. Our discussion in this course focuses on lean principles that apply broadly.

Kanban is a Japanese word used at Toyota to generically describe an object that controls the flow of work. The actual object can vary depending on the situation, but it usually holds some information related to the work. By naming this type of object a kanban, Toyota basically was adding a new definition to the word. The idea came to Toyota from the way that supermarkets manage their inventory. Taiichi Ohno mentions in his book that he once came to the US to visit car companies but he was more excited about visiting and learning from the supermarkets.

In supermarkets for some products instead of forecasting and having a product delivered at regular intervals, which is a push system, more product is only ordered when the current inventory reaches a reorder point. This is a pull system.

This matches the supply and demand. For example, the supermarket doesn't need to guess how many cans of tomatoes to order or risk having too little or too much inventory. They can wait for one of the boxes to empty, then order another box.

In this example, an empty box is acting as a kanban. It signals employees to order more product.

Taiichi Ohno said in his book, from the supermarket, we got the idea of viewing the earlier process in a production line as a kind of store. When a later process used a component such as an engine it would provide a kanban to the earlier process. That kanban could be a piece of paper with information on it or something like an empty cart. This would signal the earlier process to build another component the earlier process only builds a component when it has been given a kanban. This is sometimes called adjusting time system.

Even though the word kanban is used to represent work to do at Toyota, the concept has been around for a very long time. A guest check at a restaurant is a kanban. The work preparing an order does not start until the guest check is filled out. If no guests comes in, no orders are prepared. The information related to the order is on the guest check.

An empty coffee cup when ordering coffee can also serve as a kanban. The size of the cup, your name, and the desired ingredients provide the information that is needed to start and fill your order. This kanban also happens to be a convenient delivery vehicle for your order.

Another example of a kanban is a Jira issue. It provides information related to the work of the issue, without the Jira issue in the correct column the work shouldn't be started. You can see that all of these kanbans represent and hold information related to work to be done.

Kanbans are not used in isolation. There is an associated system to them which sets the rules on how the kanbans are used.

Taichi Ohno said that the Toyota production system is the production method,and the kanban system is the way that it is managed. He is pointing out that the kanbans are part of a kanban system.

Similarly, every restaurant uses guest check kanbans in slightly different ways, depending on the kanban system.

Also agile projects that use issues as kanbans use them in unique ways. There are many benefits to using kanban systems to manage work. Some of the benefits include, they visualize the work. Kanbans are visual, allowing you to see very clearly what work needs to be done.

They are simple. Forecasting demand and managing inventories is usually a much more complicated approach to managing the work than using kanbans.

They are reliable. This reliability comes from the visual aspect, and the simplicity of the system.

They are efficient, an effective kanban system used resources only to do work that is of value to the customer.

They eliminate waste. Instead of holding and managing inventory, the supply is matched to the demand.

And finally, it is easy to identify bottlenecks or problems in the system and make adjustments to improve the workflow. This is mainly because the simplicity and just-in-time nature of the system makes it easy to see where problems occur.

The term kanban has a few meanings, depending on the context.

Kanban may refer to an object that controls the flow of work. We have seen that restaurant guest checks and jira issues can be considered kanbans. We could call these kanban tokens to help clarify the meaning.

Kanban may also refer to the system that controls the flow of working using kanbans. We have see that Toyota has a system for how it uses kanbans just as restaurants have a system for how they use gas checks and how a team uses jira issues. We could call this a kanban system to help clarify the meaning.

We have also seen that there is a lightweight agile method called kanban.

It takes its name from the kanban system at Toyota but applies it to agile projects. This is a bit confusing because kanban tokens, kanban systems and even things like kanban boards are used in most agile methods, not only in the kanban method.
